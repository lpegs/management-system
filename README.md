MANAGEMENT SYSTEM

Basic management system using Python and MySQL.

Based on a Library Management System (as you can see from the database table names and columns), where you can issue and return books.
In this case, I used games as an example.

Both front and back end were created using Python, through Tkinter and pymysql.
